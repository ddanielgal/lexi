Introducing [[Profile]].

Your domain is your profile.

Your profile is your Fediverse profile.

[[Profile]] is a Fediverse app, at `profile.site`.

A profile shows a person's Fediverse posts.

My profile would be at `den.profile.site`.

When you sign up to [[Profile]], you get a `yourname.profile.site` domain.

My Fediverse account would be seen as `@den@profile.site`.

I could also hook up my `danielgal.eu` domain to show my [[Profile]] profile.

You can post to your [[Profile]], if you are logged in.

Your posts can be discovered and interacted with on the Fediverse.

The goal is to find people and brands online easier.

The goal is to democratize domains.

Verification is built in, using domains.

Discovery is built in, using domains.
