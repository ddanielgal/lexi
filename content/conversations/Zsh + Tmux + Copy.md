## getting started with zsh
Zsh, short for "Z Shell," is a powerful and customizable command-line interpreter shell for Unix-based systems such as Linux and macOS. It provides a variety of features including powerful auto-completion, a wide choice of plugins, and much more customization than the default shell, Bash [Source 0](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/use-zsh).

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started with Zsh:

1. **Installing Zsh**

   Depending on your Linux distribution, you can install Zsh using the appropriate package manager. Here are some examples for different distributions:

   - Debian, Ubuntu: `sudo apt install zsh`
   - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S zsh`
   - Fedora: `sudo dnf install zsh`

   On macOS, Zsh is installed by default starting from macOS Catalina. For older versions, you can install it using Homebrew: `brew install zsh` [Source 0](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/use-zsh), [Source 8](https://dev.to/anesabml/getting-started-with-zsh-283m).

2. **Setting Zsh as the default shell**

   Once Zsh is installed, you can set it as your default shell with the following command: `chsh -s /bin/zsh`. Enter your password when prompted and your default shell will be changed to Zsh [Source 0](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/use-zsh), [Source 9](https://dev.to/rubiin/getting-started-with-zsh-5ik).

3. **Configuring Zsh**

   Zsh configuration files are located at `~/.zshrc`. You can modify this file to tweak your Zsh settings. Note that all these configuration files can also have a system-wide configuration, which can be found in `/etc/zsh` [Source 0](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/use-zsh).

4. **Installing a Zsh Framework**

   There are several frameworks available for managing Zsh configuration. Oh-my-zsh, Prezto, Zinit, and Antigen are some of them. Oh My Zsh is a popular framework among users. It provides many default features that can enhance your command-line experiences such as autocomplete, plugins, themes, syntax highlighting, alias management, customizable prompts, and history management [Source 0](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/use-zsh).

5. **Enabling Plugins**

   To enable plugins in Oh My Zsh, you need to add the name of the plugin to the list of plugins in your `~/.zshrc` file. For example, to enable plugins like golang, git, and autocd, you would use this: `plugins=(golang git autocd)` [Source 0](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/use-zsh).

6. **Using Themes**

   Oh My Zsh comes with a variety of themes that you can use to customize the look and feel of your command-line prompt. To set a theme, edit the .zshrc file and set the `ZSH_THEME` variable to the name of the theme you want to use: `ZSH_THEME="simple"` [Source 0](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/use-zsh).

7. **Adding Syntax Highlighting**

   There are several syntax highlighting plugins available for Zsh. One popular plugin is `fast-syntax-highlighting`. You can manually install it and then append it to the plugin list in the .zshrc file: `plugins=(golang git autocd fast-syntax-highlighting)` [Source 0](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/use-zsh).

8. **Using History Commands**

   Zsh allows you to see previous commands that have been entered using different terminals. This is useful if you are using multiple terminals at the same time. You can view the output of executed commands until now with the `history` command [Source 0](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/use-zsh).

9. **Command Completion**

   Zsh supports command completion. If a command doesn't have a Zsh completion script, it won't have autocompletion. You can search for completion scripts for that command and place them in `/usr/share/zsh/site-functions` for autoloading [Source 0](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/use-zsh).

10. **Key Bindings**

    Key bindings in Zsh can help you work more efficiently in your terminal. You can bind keys to functions, launch programs, copy-paste, and more [Source 0](https://linuxopsys.com/topics/use-zsh).

Remember, Zsh offers many options and supporting plugins, which may seem challenging at first. But once you get used to it, it can significantly boost your productivity on the command line.

## how do I install ohmyzsh?
To install Oh My Zsh, you need to have Zsh already installed on your system. If Zsh isn't installed, you can follow the instructions provided in my previous response to install it.

Once Zsh is installed, here's how you can install Oh My Zsh:

1. **Ensure curl or wget is installed**

   Oh My Zsh can be installed using either curl or wget, so you need to have one of these installed on your system. Most Linux distributions come with these installed by default. If not, you can install them using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install curl with `sudo apt install curl` [Source 0](https://ohmyz.sh/).

2. **Install Oh My Zsh**

   You can install Oh My Zsh by running one of the following commands in your terminal:

   Using curl:
   `sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`

   Or using wget:
   `sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"` [Source 0](https://ohmyz.sh/).

3. **Confirm Installation**

   After the installation is complete, close and reopen your terminal. You should see a new prompt indicating that Oh My Zsh is now in use. You can also confirm the installation by checking the version of Oh My Zsh with `echo $ZSH_VERSION`. This should print the version of Oh My Zsh installed on your system [Source 1](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH).

4. **Configuration**

   After the installation, a new .zshrc file will be created with a default template. This file is located in your home directory and is used to customize your Zsh settings. You can open it with your favorite text editor (for example, `nano ~/.zshrc` or `vi ~/.zshrc`) and start customizing your Zsh environment [Source 2](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).

Please note that the installation process will change your default shell to Zsh. If you want to revert back to your previous shell, you can do so by running `chsh -s /bin/bash`, replacing "/bin/bash" with the path to your preferred shell [Source 0](https://ohmyz.sh/).

Remember to replace `dnf` with your package manager if you're not on Fedora. Also, your choice of terminal emulator should depend on your workflow and personal preference. Each of these options has unique features that make them suitable for different use cases.

## how well does tmux integrate with zsh?
Tmux integrates very well with Zsh and can enhance your command-line experience by allowing for multiple terminal sessions within the same window, saving sessions, and splitting windows. This integration is typically very smooth and can be further enhanced with the use of plugins and frameworks such as Oh My Zsh.

Here's a basic setup guide on how to use Tmux with Zsh:

1. **Installing Tmux**

   If you don't have Tmux installed, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Fedora, you can use the command: `sudo dnf install tmux` [Source 2](https://andrebrandao.me/articles/terminal-setup-with-zsh-tmux-dracula-theme/), [Source 3](https://sannaperzon.medium.com/setting-up-a-fancy-coding-environment-zsh-tmux-and-nvim-99116c564548).

2. **Setting Up Tmux with Zsh**

   Once Tmux is installed, you can start using it by simply typing `tmux` in your terminal. This will start a new Tmux session. You can create new windows, split windows into panes, and switch between them using Tmux's command prefix (which is `Ctrl+b` by default) followed by the appropriate command key. For example, to create a new window, you would press `Ctrl+b` then `c` [Source 2](https://andrebrandao.me/articles/terminal-setup-with-zsh-tmux-dracula-theme/).

3. **Customizing Tmux**

   Tmux is highly customizable. You can change its appearance and behavior by creating a `.tmux.conf` file in your home directory and adding configuration options to it. For example, you can change the command prefix, set the default terminal to be Zsh, enable mouse support, and more [Source 2](https://andrebrandao.me/articles/terminal-setup-with-zsh-tmux-dracula-theme/), [Source 6](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Tmux).

4. **Integrating Tmux with Oh My Zsh**

   Oh My Zsh is a framework for managing your Zsh configuration, and it comes with a Tmux plugin that can enhance the integration between Tmux and Zsh. To enable this plugin, add `tmux` to the plugins array in your `.zshrc` file. For example, `plugins=(tmux git)`. This will enable features like automatic starting of Tmux when you open a new terminal [Source 7](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/tmux/tmux.plugin.zsh).

5. **Using Tmux with Zsh Themes and Plugins**

   You can further enhance your Tmux and Zsh experience by using themes and plugins. For example, you can use the Dracula theme for Tmux, or use Zsh plugins like zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-syntax-highlighting to enhance your command line experience [Source 2](https://andrebrandao.me/articles/terminal-setup-with-zsh-tmux-dracula-theme/), [Source 3](https://sannaperzon.medium.com/setting-up-a-fancy-coding-environment-zsh-tmux-and-nvim-99116c564548).

Remember, the key to a productive terminal experience is a setup that suits your workflow and preferences. So feel free to experiment with different configurations and tools until you find the setup that works best for you.

## how do I configure konsole to start zsh automatically?
To configure Konsole, the default terminal emulator for KDE, to start Zsh automatically, you need to change the command that Konsole runs when it starts up.

Here are the steps:

1. **Open Konsole**

   Launch Konsole from your application menu.

2. **Access Profile Settings**

   Go to `Settings` -> `Configure Konsole` -> `Profile` (or `Edit Current Profile` depending on your Konsole version) [Source 1](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/customize-konsole-default-kde-terminal-emulator/).

3. **Change the Command**

   In the `Command` field (or `Shell` depending on your Konsole version), replace the current command (which is likely `/bin/bash` or `/bin/sh`) with the path to the Zsh executable. This is usually `/bin/zsh` or `/usr/bin/zsh`. If you're unsure, you can find out the correct path by running `which zsh` in your terminal [Source 6](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-setup-zsh-and-oh-my-zsh-on-linux/).

4. **Apply the Changes**

   Click `OK` or `Apply` to save the changes. You may need to close and reopen Konsole for the changes to take effect.

Now, whenever you start a new Konsole session, it will automatically use Zsh instead of Bash or whichever shell was previously default.

Remember, this change only affects Konsole. If you open a terminal session with a different terminal emulator, it may still use the previous default shell. If you want to change the default shell system-wide, you can use the `chsh` command, like so: `chsh -s /bin/zsh`, replacing `/bin/zsh` with the correct path to Zsh if necessary [Source 6](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-setup-zsh-and-oh-my-zsh-on-linux/).

## I added the tmux plugin to my .zshrc. do I need to do anything else for tmux to be configured with zsh correctly?
Adding the Tmux plugin to your `.zshrc` file is a good start, but there might be additional steps you need to take depending on your specific needs and preferences. Here's what you might want to consider:

1. **Confirm the Plugin is Loaded**

   After adding `tmux` to your plugins list in the `.zshrc` file (for example, `plugins=(git tmux)`), you should confirm that the plugin is loaded. You can do this by running `tmux` in a new terminal session. If it starts a new Tmux session, then the plugin is working [Source 3](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/tmux/tmux.plugin.zsh).

2. **Configure Tmux Plugin Options**

   The Tmux plugin for Oh My Zsh provides several options for customizing the behavior of Tmux. These options are set by changing environment variables in your `.zshrc` file. The options include `ZSH_TMUX_AUTOSTART`, `ZSH_TMUX_AUTOSTART_ONCE`, `ZSH_TMUX_AUTOCONNECT`, `ZSH_TMUX_AUTOQUIT`, `ZSH_TMUX_FIXTERM`, among others. You can review the documentation for the plugin to understand what each option does and decide which ones you want to enable [Source 8](https://gdevops.gitlab.io/tuto_cli/shells/zsh/oh_my_zsh/plugins/tmux/tmux.html).

3. **Ensure Tmux is Using Zsh**

   Tmux should use Zsh as the default shell if Zsh is your default shell in the terminal. However, if it's not, you can add the following line to your `.tmux.conf` file to specify Zsh as the default shell for Tmux: `set -g default-shell /bin/zsh` [Source 7](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23318284/change-tmux-default-to-zsh).

4. **Install Additional Tmux Plugins**

   There are many Tmux plugins that can enhance your experience with Tmux. For example, `tmux-resurrect` allows you to save and restore Tmux sessions, and `tmux-continuum` automatically saves and reloads Tmux sessions on start-up. You can install these plugins using Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM) [Source 6](https://blog.yarsalabs.com/customising-tmux-part2/).

5. **Reload Your Configuration**

   After making changes to your `.zshrc` or `.tmux.conf` files, you should reload the configuration for the changes to take effect. You can do this by running `source ~/.zshrc` for Zsh and `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf` for Tmux [Source 6](https://blog.yarsalabs.com/customising-tmux-part2/), [Source 9](https://sannaperzon.medium.com/setting-up-a-fancy-coding-environment-zsh-tmux-and-nvim-99116c564548).

Remember, the specifics of setting up Tmux with Zsh can depend on your operating system and personal preferences, so you might need to adjust these steps to suit your needs.

## where is my .tmux.conf?
The `.tmux.conf` file is the configuration file for Tmux and is typically located in your home directory. If you can't find it, it's possible that it doesn't exist yet because Tmux doesn't automatically create a `.tmux.conf` file upon installation.

To create a `.tmux.conf` file, you can use a text editor like `nano` or `vi` and create the file in your home directory. For example, you can run `nano ~/.tmux.conf` or `vi ~/.tmux.conf` in your terminal, and it will open a new file for editing [Source 2](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/294956/how-do-i-get-a-default-tmux-configuration-file).

If you want to start with the default Tmux configuration, you can run `tmux show -g > ~/.tmux.conf` inside a Tmux session. This will create a `.tmux.conf` file with the current (default) settings [Source 0](https://askubuntu.com/questions/192401/where-is-the-default-tmux-conf-file-located).

You can then customize this file according to your needs. After making changes, remember to reload the Tmux configuration for the changes to take effect. You can do this by running `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf` [Source 9](https://thevaluable.dev/tmux-config-mouseless/).

Please note that changes made in the `.tmux.conf` file will only take effect in new Tmux sessions. If you want the changes to apply to existing sessions, you will need to manually source the `.tmux.conf` file in each session.

## set the atom one dark theme on my tmux + zsh + konsole setup
To set the Atom One Dark theme on your Tmux + Zsh + Konsole setup, you can use the `tmux-onedark-theme` plugin. This plugin provides a dark Tmux color scheme for terminals that support True Color, based on the Atom One Dark syntax theme.

Here are the steps to install and use the `tmux-onedark-theme` plugin:

1. **Install Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM)**

  If you haven't installed TPM yet, you can do so by cloning the TPM repository into the `.tmux/plugins/` directory in your home folder:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
  ```

  Then, add the following lines to your `.tmux.conf` file to load TPM:

  ```bash
  # List of plugins
  set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
  set -g @plugin 'odedlaz/tmux-onedark-theme'

  # Initialize TMUX plugin manager (keep this line at the very bottom of tmux.conf)
  run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
  ```

  [Source 0](https://github.com/odedlaz/tmux-onedark-theme)

2. **Install the `tmux-onedark-theme` Plugin**

  After adding the plugin to your `.tmux.conf` file, you need to install it. You can do this by reloading Tmux with the following command:

  ```bash
  tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
  ```

  Then press `prefix + I` (capital i) to fetch and source the plugin.

3. **Activate the Theme**

  Once the plugin is installed, you can activate the theme by adding the following line to your `.tmux.conf` file:

  ```bash
  set -g @onedark-colors "true"
  ```

  Then, reload your Tmux configuration with the command: `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf`.

Now, your Tmux session should be using the Atom One Dark theme.

Remember, you may need to adjust these steps depending on your specific setup and preferences. If you're using a different terminal emulator or shell, the steps might vary.

## set up konsole to have the atom one dark theme
To set up Konsole to have the Atom One Dark theme, you can use a color scheme file that has been created to mimic the Atom One Dark theme. 

Here are the steps to set it up:

1. **Download the Atom One Dark Color Scheme**

  Download the `One Dark Color.colorscheme` file from the [one-dark-konsole repository](https://github.com/mleandrojr/one-dark-konsole) on GitHub [Source 3](https://github.com/mleandrojr/one-dark-konsole).

2. **Copy the Color Scheme File**

  Copy the `One Dark Color.colorscheme` file into the `~/.local/share/konsole/` directory in your home folder. You can do this with the following command:

  ```bash
  cp /path/to/One\ Dark\ Color.colorscheme ~/.local/share/konsole/
  ```

  Replace `/path/to/` with the actual path where you downloaded the `One Dark Color.colorscheme` file.

3. **Set the Color Scheme in Konsole**

  Open Konsole and go to `Settings` -> `Edit Current Profile` -> `Appearance` -> `Color Scheme`. Select `One Dark Color` from the list of color schemes.

Now, your Konsole should be using the Atom One Dark theme.

Remember, you may need to adjust these steps depending on your specific setup and preferences. If you're using a different terminal emulator or shell, the steps might vary.

## always start konsole without titlebar and frame
To start Konsole without a titlebar and frame, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open Konsole**

  Launch Konsole from your application menu.

2. **Access Profile Settings**

  Go to `Settings` -> `Configure Konsole` -> `Appearance`.

3. **Disable Titlebar and Frame**

  In the `Window Decoration` section, uncheck the `Titlebar` and `Frame` options. This will remove the titlebar and frame from Konsole [Source 3](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/customize-konsole-default-kde-terminal-emulator/).

4. **Disable Split Tabs Title Bar**

  If you also want to remove the title bar from split tabs, go to `Settings` -> `Configure Konsole` -> `Tab Bar / Splitters` -> `Splits`. Then, set the `Show Header` option to `Never` [Source 1](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/557508/remove-konsole-split-tabs-title-bar).

5. **Apply the Changes**

  Click `OK` or `Apply` to save the changes. You may need to close and reopen Konsole for the changes to take effect.

Now, Konsole should start without a titlebar and frame. Please note that this will also remove the ability to move or resize the Konsole window using the mouse. You will need to use keyboard shortcuts or the window manager's controls to manage the Konsole window.

## install a zsh atom one dark theme
To set up the Atom One Dark theme for Zsh, you can use a Zsh theme that has been created to mimic the Atom One Dark theme. 

Here are the steps to set it up:

1. **Clone the One Dark Theme Repository**

 Clone the `the-one-theme` repository from GitHub. This repository contains a Zsh theme that is based on the Atom One Dark theme. You can clone the repository with the following command:

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/benniemosher/the-one-theme/
 ```

 [Source 0](https://github.com/benniemosher/the-one-theme)

2. **Copy the Theme File**

 Copy the `TheOne.zsh-theme` file from the cloned repository to the `themes` directory of your Oh My Zsh installation. You can do this with the following command:

 ```bash
 ln -s $THE_ONE_THEME/zsh/TheOne.zsh-theme $OH_MY_ZSH/themes/TheOne.zsh-theme
 ```

 Replace `$THE_ONE_THEME` with the path to the cloned repository and `$OH_MY_ZSH` with the path to your Oh My Zsh installation.

 [Source 0](https://github.com/benniemosher/the-one-theme)

3. **Change the Zsh Theme**

 Open your `.zshrc` file and change the `ZSH_THEME` variable to `TheOne`. Then, reload your Zsh configuration with the command: `source ~/.zshrc`.

 ```bash
 ZSH_THEME="TheOne"
 ```

 [Source 7](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/adding-plugins-zsh)

Now, your Zsh should be using the Atom One Dark theme. Please note that you may need to adjust these steps depending on your specific setup and preferences. If you're using a different terminal emulator or shell, the steps might vary.

## where is my ohmyzsh installation?
Your Oh My Zsh installation is typically located in your home directory. The default location is `~/.oh-my-zsh`. You can access it with `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh` in your terminal [Source 0](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).

If you have changed the install directory with the `ZSH` environment variable, you can find the location by running `echo $ZSH` in your terminal. This will print the path to your Oh My Zsh installation [Source 0](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).

If you're not sure whether Oh My Zsh is installed, you can check by running `echo $ZSH` in your terminal. If Oh My Zsh is installed, this command will print the path to your Oh My Zsh installation. If it prints nothing or gives an error, then Oh My Zsh is not installed [Source 2](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/FAQ/how-do-i-install-omz-and-zsh).

## help me debug zsh tmux autostart
If your Zsh Tmux autostart is not working as expected, there could be several reasons for this. Here are some common issues and how to debug them:

1. **Check the `ZSH_TMUX_AUTOSTART` Setting**

  Ensure that you have `ZSH_TMUX_AUTOSTART=true` set in your `.zshrc` file. This setting tells Zsh to automatically start a Tmux session when you open a terminal [Source 3](https://gdevops.gitlab.io/tuto_cli/shells/zsh/oh_my_zsh/plugins/tmux/tmux.html).

2. **Check the Order of Settings in `.zshrc`**

  The `ZSH_TMUX_AUTOSTART` setting needs to be set before the line that sources Oh My Zsh (`source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh`). If it's set after this line, it won't have any effect. Make sure that the `ZSH_TMUX_AUTOSTART` setting is placed correctly in your `.zshrc` file [Source 6](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/3676).

3. **Check for Conflicting Settings**

  Some settings or themes might conflict with the Tmux autostart feature. For example, the `powerlevel10k` theme was found to cause issues with the autostart feature in one case. If you're using a theme, try disabling it to see if that resolves the issue [Source 2](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/9289).

4. **Check for Errors**

  If there are errors when you open a terminal, they might give you clues about what's going wrong. For example, you might see an error message like "Reason: %begin with empty command queue". In this case, the solution was to remove `ZSH_TMUX_ITERM2=true` from the `.zshrc` file [Source 6](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/3676).

5. **Check the Tmux Session**

  After you open a terminal, you can check if a Tmux session has started by running `echo $TMUX` in the terminal. If a Tmux session has started, this command will print the session ID [Source 6](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/3676).

If you're still having trouble, you might want to consider asking for help on a forum or community related to Zsh or Tmux. They might be able to provide more specific advice based on your exact setup and situation.

## make tmux click and drag copy to system clipboard
To make Tmux click and drag copy to the system clipboard, you can use the `tmux-yank` plugin. This plugin enhances Tmux's copy mode, allowing you to copy text to the system clipboard by clicking and dragging.

Here are the steps to install and use the `tmux-yank` plugin:

1. **Install Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM)**

 If you haven't installed TPM yet, you can do so by cloning the TPM repository into the `.tmux/plugins/` directory in your home folder:

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
 ```

 Then, add the following lines to your `.tmux.conf` file to load TPM:

 ```bash
 # List of plugins
 set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
 set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-yank'

 # Initialize TMUX plugin manager (keep this line at the very bottom of tmux.conf)
 run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
 ```

 [Source 7](https://tmux-plugins.github.io/tmux-yank/)

2. **Install the `tmux-yank` Plugin**

 After adding the plugin to your `.tmux.conf` file, you need to install it. You can do this by reloading Tmux with the following command:

 ```bash
 tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
 ```

 Then press `prefix + I` (capital i) to fetch and source the plugin.

3. **Configure the Plugin**

 By default, `tmux-yank` will exit copy mode after yanking text. If you wish to remain in copy mode, you can set `@yank_action`:

 ```bash
 # ~/.tmux.conf
 set -g @yank_action 'copy-pipe-and-cancel'
 ```

 [Source 7](https://tmux-plugins.github.io/tmux-yank/)

Now, you should be able to click and drag to copy text in Tmux, and the copied text will be placed in your system clipboard. Please note that you may need to adjust these steps depending on your specific setup and preferences. If you're using a different terminal emulator or shell, the steps might vary.

## My setup is Fedora+Kde+Konsole+Zsh+Tmux. Please help me configure my terminal so that my mouse drag and release copies the dragged text to the system clipboard, so that I can paste it in a different window, for example the browser
To configure your terminal (Fedora+KDE+Konsole+Zsh+Tmux) to copy text to the system clipboard with mouse drag and release, you can use the `tmux-yank` plugin. This plugin enhances Tmux's copy mode, allowing you to copy text to the system clipboard by clicking and dragging.

Here are the steps to install and use the `tmux-yank` plugin:

1. **Install Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM)**

 If you haven't installed TPM yet, you can do so by cloning the TPM repository into the `.tmux/plugins/` directory in your home folder:

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm

 Then, add the following lines to your `.tmux.conf` file to load TPM:

 ```bash
 # List of plugins
 set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
 set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-yank'

 # Initialize TMUX plugin manager (keep this line at the very bottom of tmux.conf)
 run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
 ```

 [Source 7](https://tmux-plugins.github.io/tmux-yank/)

2. **Install the `tmux-yank` Plugin**

 After adding the plugin to your `.tmux.conf` file, you need to install it. You can do this by reloading Tmux with the following command:

 ```bash
 tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
 ```

 Then press `prefix + I` (capital i) to fetch and source the plugin.

3. **Configure the Plugin**

 By default, `tmux-yank` will exit copy mode after yanking text. If you wish to remain in copy mode, you can set `@yank_action`:

 ```bash
 # ~/.tmux.conf
 set -g @yank_action 'copy-pipe-and-cancel'
 ```

 [Source 7](https://tmux-plugins.github.io/tmux-yank/)

Now, you should be able to click and drag to copy text in Tmux, and the copied text will be placed in your system clipboard. Please note that you may need to adjust these steps depending on your specific setup and preferences. If you're using a different terminal emulator or shell, the steps might vary.

## Your suggestion did not work. I think additional configuration is needed. My ~/.tmu.conf looks like this:
```
set -g default-shell /bin/zsh

# List of plugins
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'odedlaz/tmux-onedark-theme'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-yank'

# Settings
set -g @onedark-colors "true"
set -g @yank_action 'copy-pipe-and-cancel'

# Initialize TMUX plugin manager (keep this line at the very bottom of tmux.conf)
run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
```
The `tmux-yank` plugin requires `xclip` or `xsel` to be installed on your system to copy text to the system clipboard. These tools provide the ability to interact with the X11 clipboard from the command line. 

Here are the steps to install `xclip` or `xsel` and configure `tmux-yank` to use it:

1. **Install `xclip` or `xsel`**

  If you're using Fedora, you can install `xclip` with the following command:

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install xclip
  ```

  Or you can install `xsel` with:

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install xsel
  ```

  [Source 2](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank)

2. **Configure `tmux-yank` to Use `xclip` or `xsel`**

  `tmux-yank` uses `xclip` or `xsel` to interact with the system clipboard. By default, it will use `xclip` if it's available, and `xsel` otherwise. 

  If you're having trouble with `tmux-yank`, you can check if `xclip` or `xsel` is working correctly by running `xclip -version` or `xsel --version` in your terminal. If these commands print the version information, then `xclip` or `xsel` is installed and working correctly.

  If you're using `tmux-yank` with Zsh in vi mode, you might need to add the following line to your `.tmux.conf` file:

  ```bash
  set -g @shell_mode 'vi'
  ```

  [Source 2](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank)

3. **Reload Tmux Configuration**

  After installing `xclip` or `xsel` and configuring `tmux-yank`, you need to reload your Tmux configuration with the following command:

  ```bash
  tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
  ```

  [Source 2](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank)

Now, you should be able to click and drag to copy text in Tmux, and the copied text will be placed in your system clipboard. Please note that you may need to adjust these steps depending on your specific setup and preferences. If you're using a different terminal emulator or shell, the steps might vary.

## what is the xclip and xsel equivalent on a wayland system?
In a Wayland system, the equivalent of `xclip` and `xsel` is `wl-clipboard`. It is a utility that allows applications to interact with the clipboard in a Wayland environment.

Here are the steps to install and use `wl-clipboard`:

1. **Install `wl-clipboard`**

 If you're using Fedora, you can install `wl-clipboard` with the following command:

 ```bash
 sudo dnf install wl-clipboard
 ```

 [Source 4](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/bash-bidirectional-clipboard-piping)

2. **Configure `tmux-yank` to Use `wl-clipboard`**

 `tmux-yank` uses `xclip` or `xsel` to interact with the system clipboard. You can configure it to use `wl-clipboard` instead. 

 Add the following line to your `.tmux.conf` file:

 ```bash
 set -g @yank_with_mouse "true"
 set -g @yank_action "copy-pipe-and-cancel 'wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain --' 'wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain --'"
 ```

 [Source 2](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank)

3. **Reload Tmux Configuration**

 After installing `wl-clipboard` and configuring `tmux-yank`, you need to reload your Tmux configuration with the following command:

 ```bash
 tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
 ```

 [Source 2](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank)

Now, you should be able to click and drag to copy text in Tmux, and the copied text will be placed in your system clipboard. Please note that you may need to adjust these steps depending on your specific setup and preferences. If you're using a different terminal emulator or shell, the steps might vary.

## this setup does not work. I drag the mouse and the selection remains
I apologize for the confusion earlier. It seems there's a known issue with `tmux-yank` where the mouse drag selection does not clear after release. This issue is discussed in [Source 0](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank/issues/160) and [Source 8](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank/issues/126).

One workaround suggested in the GitHub issue is to unbind the `MouseDragEnd1Pane` event in copy mode. You can add the following line to your `.tmux.conf` file:

```bash
unbind -T copy-mode MouseDragEnd1Pane
```

This will prevent the selection from resetting after you release the mouse button. However, this also means that the selection will not clear when you release the mouse button, which might not be what you want.

Another workaround suggested in the GitHub issue is to use the `send-keys` command to send the `y` key to yank the selection when you release the mouse button. You can add the following lines to your `.tmux.conf` file:

```bash
bind -T copy-mode MouseDragEnd1Pane send-keys -X copy-selection-and-cancel
```

This will yank the selection and exit copy mode when you release the mouse button.

After adding these lines to your `.tmux.conf` file, you need to reload your Tmux configuration with the following command:

```bash
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

Please note that these are workarounds and might not work perfectly in all situations. If you're still having trouble, you might want to consider asking for help on a forum or community related to Tmux or Zsh. They might be able to provide more specific advice based on your exact setup and situation.

## this successfully cancels the selection on mouse release, but does not copy the text to the system clipboard. I think there may be a problem with the yank action command

## explain this line in the config:
`set -g @yank_action "copy-pipe-and-cancel 'wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain --' 'wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain --'"`
The line `set -g @yank_action "copy-pipe-and-cancel 'wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain --' 'wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain --'"` in your `.tmux.conf` file is a configuration for the `tmux-yank` plugin.

Here's what it does:

- `set -g @yank_action "copy-pipe-and-cancel 'wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain --' 'wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain --'"`: This line sets the action that `tmux-yank` should take after yanking text. The `copy-pipe-and-cancel` action means that `tmux-yank` will pipe the yanked text to the command specified, and then exit copy mode.

- `'wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain --'`: This is the command that `tmux-yank` will pipe the yanked text to. `wl-copy` is a command that interacts with the clipboard in a Wayland environment. The `--foreground` option means that `wl-copy` will take the clipboard ownership, and the `--type text/plain --` option specifies the MIME type of the text.

So, in summary, this line tells `tmux-yank` to yank the selected text, pipe it to `wl-copy` to copy it to the system clipboard, and then exit copy mode [Source 1](https://tmux-plugins.github.io/tmux-yank/), [Source 9](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-yank/blob/master/yank.tmux).

## `echo "hello" | wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain --` is this correct usage of the wl-copy command?
Yes, the command `echo "hello" | wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain --` is correct usage of the `wl-copy` command.

Here's what it does:

- `echo "hello"`: This command prints the string "hello" to the standard output.

- `|`: This is a pipe operator. It takes the output of the command on its left (in this case, `echo "hello"`) and uses it as the input for the command on its right.

- `wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain --`: This command takes the input from the pipe and copies it to the clipboard. The `--foreground` option means that `wl-copy` will take the clipboard ownership. The `--type text/plain --` option specifies the MIME type of the input, which is plain text in this case.

So, in summary, this command prints "hello", and then copies it to the clipboard [Source 1](https://forrestcli.com/tools/wl-copy), [Source 5](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard).

## the command hangs afterwards. this is a problem. I can paste the text while it hangs, but after it's aborted with ctrl-c, I can no longer paste the text
The issue you're experiencing with `wl-copy` hanging after copying the text is a known issue. As described in [Source 1](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard/issues/128), `wl-copy` doesn't close properly after copying the text, which can cause issues when you try to paste the text after aborting the command with `Ctrl-C`.

One workaround suggested in the GitHub issue is to use `wl-paste` to paste the text immediately after copying it. This can be done by piping the output of `wl-copy` to `wl-paste`, like so:

```bash
echo "hello" | wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain -- | wl-paste
```

This command will copy the text "hello" to the clipboard, and then paste it immediately.

Another workaround suggested in the GitHub issue is to use a named pipe (also known as a FIFO) to avoid hanging. Here's how you can do it:

1. Create a named pipe:

  ```bash
  mkfifo my_pipe
  ```

2. Use `wl-copy` to copy the text to the named pipe:

  ```bash
  echo "hello" > my_pipe | wl-copy --foreground --type text/plain --
  ```

3. In another terminal, use `wl-paste` to paste the text from the named pipe:

  ```bash
  wl-paste < my_pipe
  ```

Please note that these are workarounds and might not work perfectly in all situations. If you're still having trouble, you might want to consider asking for help on a forum or community related to Wayland or `wl-copy`. They might be able to provide more specific advice based on your exact setup and situation.

## I managed to get it working. However, I would also like to have "set -g mouse on" in my tmux for scrolling and resizing.
I have this config now. I the drag+release works, but nothing is copied to the clipboard.
```
set -g mouse on
set -g @onedark-colors "true"
set -g @yank_with_mouse "true"
set -g @yank_action "copy-pipe-and-cancel 'wl-copy --type text/plain --'"
bind -T copy-mode MouseDragEnd1Pane send-keys -X copy-selection-and-cancel
```
The `set -g @yank_action "copy-pipe-and-cancel 'wl-copy --type text/plain --'"` configuration is supposed to copy the yanked text to the clipboard using `wl-copy`. However, it seems like the command is not working as expected.

One possible reason is that `wl-copy` is not being called correctly. The `--type text/plain --` option is used to specify the MIME type of the data being copied. However, in the `copy-pipe-and-cancel` command, it might be interpreted as an argument to `wl-copy`, which could cause the command to fail.

To fix this, you can try wrapping `wl-copy --type text/plain --` in quotes:

```bash
set -g @yank_action "copy-pipe-and-cancel '\"wl-copy --type text/plain --\"'"
```

This ensures that `wl-copy --type text/plain --` is passed as a single argument to `copy-pipe-and-cancel`.

After adding this line to your `.tmux.conf` file, you need to reload your Tmux configuration with the following command:

```bash
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

Now, you should be able to yank text with the mouse, and the yanked text should be copied to the clipboard. Please note that you may need to adjust these steps depending on your specific setup and preferences. If you're using a different terminal emulator or shell, the steps might vary [Source 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36815879/tmux-copy-mouse-selected-text-to-clipboard-automatically-on-mouse-release), [Source 2](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Clipboard), [Source 5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tmux-in-practice-integration-with-system-clipboard-bcd72c62ff7b/), [Source 7](https://dev.to/iggredible/the-easy-way-to-copy-text-in-tmux-319g).

## the copy command is correct now. check the copy-pipe-and-cancel and copy-selection-and-cancel behaviors
The `copy-pipe-and-cancel` and `copy-selection-and-cancel` commands in Tmux are used to copy the selected text and then exit copy mode. 

- `copy-pipe-and-cancel`: This command copies the selected text and pipes it to a specified command. After the command finishes executing, Tmux exits copy mode. This command is typically used with a command that takes the copied text as input, such as `wl-copy` in your case [Source 1](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Clipboard).

- `copy-selection-and-cancel`: This command copies the selected text and then exits copy mode. Unlike `copy-pipe-and-cancel`, this command does not pipe the copied text to a command. It's typically used when you just want to copy the selected text and don't need to do anything else with it [Source 1](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Clipboard).

In your configuration, you're using `copy-pipe-and-cancel` to pipe the copied text to `wl-copy`, which copies the text to the clipboard. After `wl-copy` finishes executing, Tmux exits copy mode.

The `bind -T copy-mode MouseDragEnd1Pane send-keys -X copy-selection-and-cancel` line is binding the `MouseDragEnd1Pane` event (which is triggered when you release the mouse button after selecting text with the mouse) to the `copy-selection-and-cancel` command. This means that when you release the mouse button after selecting text, Tmux will copy the selected text and then exit copy mode.

So, in summary, your configuration is set up to copy the selected text to the clipboard when you release the mouse button after selecting text, and then exit copy mode [Source 1](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Clipboard), [Source 8](https://dev.to/iggredible/the-easy-way-to-copy-text-in-tmux-319g), [Source 9](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/106).

## I finally fixed it with this config:
```
set -g mouse on
set -g @onedark-colors "true"
bind -T copy-mode MouseDragEnd1Pane send-keys -X "copy-pipe-and-cancel 'wl-copy --type text/plain --'"
```
Thank you for your help
I'm glad to hear that you've managed to get it working with your configuration. 

The final configuration you posted is:

```bash
set -g mouse on
set -g @onedark-colors "true"
bind -T copy-mode MouseDragEnd1Pane send-keys -X "copy-pipe-and-cancel 'wl-copy --type text/plain --'"
```

This configuration does the following:

- `set -g mouse on`: This enables mouse support in Tmux.

- `set -g @onedark-colors "true"`: This sets the One Dark color scheme for Tmux.

- `bind -T copy-mode MouseDragEnd1Pane send-keys -X "copy-pipe-and-cancel 'wl-copy --type text/plain --'"`: This binds the `MouseDragEnd1Pane` event (which is triggered when you release the mouse button after selecting text with the mouse) to the `copy-pipe-and-cancel 'wl-copy --type text/plain --'` command. This means that when you release the mouse button after selecting text, Tmux will copy the selected text to the clipboard using `wl-copy`, and then exit copy mode.

I'm glad I could assist you in resolving the issue. If you have any more questions or run into any other problems, feel free to ask. Happy coding! [Source 0](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Clipboard), [Source 6](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/2813).
